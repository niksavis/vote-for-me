- **Git** (optional) - For cloning the repository

### Quick Start

#### Windows (Recommended)

```batch
# Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/niksavis/vote-for-me.git
cd vote-for-me

# For development (includes email testing server)
run-development.bat

# For production (requires email configuration)
run-production.bat
```

#### All Platforms (Manual)

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies and run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Access Your Application

After starting, you'll see URLs like:

```text
üó≥Ô∏è  VOTE FOR ME - VOTING PLATFORM
============================
üìç Local Access:     http://127.0.0.1:5000
üåê Network Access:   http://192.168.1.100:5000
```

Open any URL in your browser to get started!

### HTTPS Setup (Optional)

The app automatically detects SSL certificates and switches between HTTP and HTTPS modes:

**üöÄ First Time Setup (No SSL certificates)**:

- App runs on HTTP only: <http://localhost:5000>
- This is the default mode for new installations

**üîí With SSL Certificates**:

- App automatically switches to HTTPS only: <https://localhost:5000>
- HTTP will not be available once certificates are present

To enable HTTPS, generate SSL certificates:

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificates for local development
python generate_ssl.py
```

After generating certificates:

- **Local HTTPS**: <https://localhost:5000> (replaces HTTP)
- **Network HTTPS**: <https://YOUR_IP:5000>

**Important**: The app runs on either HTTP OR HTTPS, never both simultaneously. SSL certificates determine which mode is used.

**Note**: Self-signed certificates will show a browser security warning that you can safely bypass for local development.
